    /*
     * ISSUE: Test expects SQLite write connection acquisition to timeout when connection is held by transaction.
     *
     * THEORIES FOR FAILURE:
     * 1. SQLite Pooled Driver Missing: The test requires "sqlite-pooled" driver which may not be properly
     *    installed or configured in the test environment, causing connections[0] to be undefined and
     *    leading to "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors when accessing createQueryRunner().
     *
     * 2. WAL Mode Configuration Issues: The test enables WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode which requires
     *    specific SQLite configuration and permissions. The test environment may not support WAL mode
     *    or may have file system restrictions that prevent WAL file creation.
     *
     * 3. Timeout Precision Problems: The 1ms acquireTimeout may be too short for the test environment,
     *    or the timeout mechanism may not be working correctly in the SQLite driver, causing the
     *    second transaction to hang indefinitely instead of timing out as expected.
     *
     * POTENTIAL FIXES:
     * - Ensure sqlite-pooled driver is properly installed and available in test environment
     * - Add proper WAL mode support validation and fallback for restricted environments
     * - Fix timeout handling mechanism in SQLite pooled connection driver

    /*
     * ISSUE: Test expects SQLite write connection acquisition to timeout for non-transaction operations.
     *
     * THEORIES FOR FAILURE:
     * 1. Connection Unavailability: Same as above test - the sqlite-pooled driver may not be properly
     *    initialized, causing connections[0] to be undefined and resulting in runtime errors when
     *    attempting to create query runners for the timeout test.
     *
     * 2. Write Lock Mechanism Issues: SQLite's write locking may not be properly implemented in the
     *    pooled driver, allowing concurrent write operations that should be serialized, or the lock
     *    acquisition logic may not respect the timeout settings properly.
     *
     * 3. Query Execution Context Problems: The test may be running in an environment where SQLite
     *    operations are executed differently (in-memory vs file-based), affecting the locking behavior
     *    and timeout mechanisms that the test expects to verify.
     *
     * POTENTIAL FIXES:
     * - Same driver availability fixes as previous test
     * - Implement proper write lock serialization in SQLite pooled driver
     * - Add environment-specific handling for different SQLite operation contexts
